# WiFi-FRL
MATLAB simulation of Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) for collaborative channel selection in dense WLANs. Implements local (MAB-based) and global learning models for Wi-Fi 7 m-AP coordination, improving spectrum reuse, fairness, and network throughput via collaborative spectrum reuse (C-SR).
